    <p>
        This web extension can block YouTube videos from view based on keywords or channel name.
        It features a very basic password protection and the block message is user-customizable.

        Originally this was developed for a person who is easily scared and needed to be protected from certain youtube searches. Because there was no easy way to do this I developed this application.
        It is made for this person but published as an extension to possibly help other people who may have the same needs!
